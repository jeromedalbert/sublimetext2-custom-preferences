# RailsCast+Textmate theme for Sublime Text

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DT1tq0x.png" border="0">

I was not satisfied with available Railscast color schemes for Sublime Text on OS X. Colors were darker than on Textmate !
I also missed parts of the Textmate look and feel : neat grey gutter, classy grey tabs, etc.

Here is my attempt to fix these issues.

## Prerequisites

Install the [Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).

## Installation

In your Sublime `Packages` folder, type:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jdalbert/sublime-text-railscasttextmate-theme.git "Theme - RailscastTextmate"

Then copy/paste the following at the end of your Sublime preferences file :

    "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - RailscastTextmate/railscast-textmate.tmtheme",
    "theme": "RailsCastTextmate.sublime-theme",
    "caret_style": "wide",
    "highlight_line": false,
    "highlight_modified_tabs": true,
    "line_padding_bottom": 1,
    "line_padding_top": 1,
    "margin": 0,
    "soda_folder_icons": true
